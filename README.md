### Hi, I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm really excited about building user-oriented software! In high school,
I ran my own tech support company. At the time, it was an extension of
my love for tinkering and making my own stuff work better. I realized
that it was a skill I could use to help others. Over time, I found
that improving things for users and other people can be a truly
driving aspect of software development! The fanciest, best
optimized code in the world is useless unless users can
figure out how to make it work.

Since then, I've worked for a handful of different companies, all of which
are focused on reducing and eliminating pain points for customers. By
working at Solo Labs, and now The Restaurant Store, I've been able
to apply my user-centric philosophy, keep myself under a critical
eye, and work with other talented developers with the end goal
of building great software. Whether it's for our customers,
or our internal users, it's always an opportunity to
recognize problems and find creative solutions.

**That creative problem solving is what drives me to improve every day!**

Thanks for taking the time to read a bit about me. Now go out there and
solve some problems!
